This project contain a function called merger that merge two parameter based on their types: it sums numbers, concatenates strings, and returns null for other types.

### Explanation of Operators with the Same Symbol but Different Behavior

In JavaScript, some operators have the same symbol but behave differently based on the types of the operands.

Why Does This Happen?
JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning it automatically converts data types in certain operations. This is known as type coercion. When using for example +, JavaScript follows these rules:
If both operands are numbers, perform addition.

If at least one operand is a string, convert the other to a string and concatenate.
