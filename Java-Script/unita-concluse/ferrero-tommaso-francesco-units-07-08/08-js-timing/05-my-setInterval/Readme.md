## Test of the exercise

### My setInterval

● Pretend that setInterval() doesn't exist  
● Re-create it using setTimeout naming your function mySetInterval  
● Test your new function  
● Modify your function so that it automatically stops after 15 intervals

## Description of the solution of the exercise

This project shows how to recreate the behavior of setInterval using only setTimeout.

The function mySetInterval(callback, delay) runs a given function (callback) every set amount of time (delay in milliseconds).

After 15 repetitions, it automatically stops.
