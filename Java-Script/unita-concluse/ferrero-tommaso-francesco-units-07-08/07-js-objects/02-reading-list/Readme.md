## Test of the exercise

### Reading list

● Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).  
● Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".  
● Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
