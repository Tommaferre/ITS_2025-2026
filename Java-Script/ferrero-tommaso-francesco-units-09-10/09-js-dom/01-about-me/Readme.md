## Test of the exercise

Add an external javascript file called main.js  
In JavaScript: 
- Change the body style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif"
 - Replace each of the spans (nickname, favorites, hometown) with your own information
 - Iterate through each li and change the class to "list-item"
 - Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you
 - Append that element to the page  
- Add an external css file using Javascript
 - The external css file should make items with the .list-item class white, bold and with an orange background
 - The external css file should be applied after 4 seconds

## Description of the solution of the exercise

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.  
Features implemented:
- Font update: change the entire page's font to Times new Roman, Serif
- Content insertion: fills in `<span>` elements about my personal information like name, favourites and hometown
- Class assignment to List Items: all `<li>` elements on the page are assigned a class of "list-tem" for consistent styling via CSS
- Image insertion: add a profile picture dinamically on the page with fixed dimensions
- Delayed external Style loading: After 4 seconds an external CSS file is loaded into the page.
