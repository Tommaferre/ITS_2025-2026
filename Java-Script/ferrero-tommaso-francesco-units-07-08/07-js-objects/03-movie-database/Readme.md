## Description of the solution of the exercise

In this exercise i've created an object to store information about movies: title, duration and the stars acting in it. After i've crated an array of objects that holds several movies, specifically in this case two movies. Then we find a function to print out the movie information, that it's called for the first time to print one movie, and after called for every movie in the array thanks to a for loop.
