## Test of the exercise

### Timed calculator

● We will modify ‘Calculator’ exercise from the lesson about functions  
● Rewrite the last function that performs all 4 operations so that there is a delay of 3 seconds between one operation and the next

## Description of the solution of the exercise

This project performs a sequence of mathematical operations on a given number, introducing a 3-second delay between each operation.

The function timedCalculate(num):

- Divides the number by 2 and prints the result (Immediately).

- Squares the number and prints the result (after 3 seconds).

- Calculates the area of a circle using the number as the radius (after another 3 seconds, 6 from the beginning).

- Calculates what percentage the original number represents compared to the area (after another 3 seconds, 9 in total from the beginning).

Results are rounded to two decimal places where necessary for clarity.
