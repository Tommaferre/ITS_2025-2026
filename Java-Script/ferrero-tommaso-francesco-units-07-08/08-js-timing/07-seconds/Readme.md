## Test of the exercise

### Seconds

Write two functions that based on the current date and time output the number of seconds:  

- getSecondsToday() returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today  

- getSecondsToTomorrow() returns the number of seconds till tomorrow

## Description of the solution of the exercise

This project provides two JavaScript functions:

- getSecondsToday(): Calculates the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning of the current day (midnight).

- getSecondsToTomorrow(): Calculates the number of seconds remaining until the start of the next day (tomorrow at midnight).

Both functions utilize the JavaScript Date object and basic arithmetic operations to achieve precise timing information.
