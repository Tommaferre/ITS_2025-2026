# TIMED CONVERSION

## Test of the exercise

### Timed conversion

● We will modify ‘Temperature conversion’ exercise from the lesson about functions  

● Call celsiusToFahrenheit on temperatures from 0 to 100 so that one temperature is printed to the console every second  

- Use setInterval to achieve this goal.
- Do the same thing using setTimeout.

## Description of the solution of the exercise

This JavaScript code demonstrates two ways to print temperature conversions from Celsius to Fahrenheit (1°C up to 100°C): one using setInterval and the other using a recursive setTimeout.  

The formula used for conversion (taken from the previous exercise temperature conversion from the lesson about function) is:

Fahrenheit = ((Celsius × 9) / 5) + 32
